# ChiPy 8
A [Chip 8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8) interpeter for Python 3.

Tested and works in Python 3.4.3. There's probably some stupid bugs. I don't know if it even runs at the right speed. It was mostly for fun.

Requires pygame. Version compatible with Python 3.4 can be found [here](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pygame).
